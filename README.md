Hi, there. I'm Aaron.

I'm a Network Engineer by trade, so don't use my code as a template for your dev stuff. ðŸ˜º I do a lot of task-based automation with #python and some #ansible.
I have yet to get into the whole pipeline thing, but I'm getting close. ðŸ˜†

I'm also a ham radio operator ðŸ“» and do some coding for that. It's nothing earth-shattering, but keep an eye out for that stuff.
